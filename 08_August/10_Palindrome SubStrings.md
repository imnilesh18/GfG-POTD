## üìù Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, count all palindromic sub-strings present in the string. The length of the palindromic sub-string must be **greater than or equal to 2**.

**Note:** A substring is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

## üß™ Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: All palindromic substrings (of length > 1) are: "aba", "aa", "baab".
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example Breakdown</summary>

Let's walk through the input `s = "abbaeae"` from the dry run:

- **Odd-length palindromes:**
  - Center at `e` (index 4): `aea` is a palindrome. `count = 1`.
  - Center at `a` (index 5): `eae` is a palindrome. `count = 2`.
- **Even-length palindromes:**
  - Center between `b` and `b` (indices 1, 2): `bb` is a palindrome. `count = 3`.
  - Expanding from `bb`: `abba` is also a palindrome. `count = 4`.

The final count of palindromic substrings with length >= 2 is **4**.

</details>

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: All palindromic substrings (of length > 1) are: "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "abbaeae"
Output: 4
Explanation: All palindromic substrings (of length > 1) are: "bb", "abba", "aea", "eae".
```

## üí° Solution Approaches

### Optimized Approach: Expand from Center

The most efficient approach for this problem is to use the "Expand from Center" technique. The fundamental idea is that every palindrome is symmetric around a central point. This center can be a single character (for odd-length palindromes like "aba") or the space between two adjacent characters (for even-length palindromes like "abba").

We iterate through all `2N-1` potential centers in the string. For each center, we expand outwards with two pointers, `left` and `right`, as long as the pointers are within the string bounds and the characters at those positions match. Each time they match, we've found a valid palindromic substring, so we increment our counter.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: Every palindrome has a center. We can iterate through all possible centers and expand outwards to count all palindromes. A center can be a single character (for odd length) or a pair of adjacent characters (for even length).
// Approach: Expand around center for each index (for odd and even length palindromes).
// Time Complexity: O(n^2) - In the worst case, each of the 2n-1 centers expands across the entire string.
// Space Complexity: O(1) - Only a few extra variables are used for pointers and the counter.

class Solution {
  public:
    int countPS(string &s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int count = 0;

        // Count odd length palindromic substrings (using each character as center)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = i - 1;
            int right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s[left] == s[right]) {
                count++;        // Found a palindrome (length >= 3)
                left--;         // Expand to the left
                right++;        // Expand to the right
            }
        }

        // Count even length palindromic substrings (using adjacent characters as center)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = i;
            int right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s[left] == s[right]) {
                count++;        // Found a palindrome (length 2 or more)
                left--;         // Expand to the left
                right++;        // Expand to the right
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

#### Java Solution

```java
// Intuition: Every palindrome is symmetric. We can treat each character and each pair of adjacent characters as a potential center and expand outwards to find all palindromes.
// Approach: Expand around center for each index (for odd and even length palindromes).
// Time Complexity: O(n^2) - We check 2n-1 potential centers, and each expansion can take O(n) time.
// Space Complexity: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

class Solution {
    public int countPS(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;

        // Count odd length palindromic substrings (center is a single character)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = i - 1;
            int right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                count++;        // Found a palindrome of length >= 3
                left--;         // Expand outwards
                right++;
            }
        }

        // Count even length palindromic substrings (center is between two characters)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int left = i;
            int right = i + 1;
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                count++;        // Found a palindrome of length >= 2
                left--;         // Expand outwards
                right++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

## üéØ Key Insights

- **Time vs. Space Trade-off**: While dynamic programming can also solve this in O(N^2) time, it requires O(N^2) space to store the palindrome table. The "Expand from Center" method provides the same time complexity but with a superior O(1) space complexity, making it the preferred solution.
- **Handling All Centers**: The key to correctness is ensuring all `2N-1` potential centers are checked. A separate loop for odd-length (N centers at `i`) and even-length (N-1 centers between `i` and `i+1`) guarantees complete coverage.
