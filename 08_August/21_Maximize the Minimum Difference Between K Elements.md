## üìù Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of integers and an integer `k`, select `k` elements from the array such that the **minimum** absolute difference between any two of the selected elements is **maximized**. Return this **maximum** possible **minimum** difference.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 2, 5], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
3 elements out of 4 elements are to be selected with a minimum difference as large as possible.
- Selecting {2, 2, 5} will result in a minimum difference of 0.
- Selecting {2, 5, 6} will result in a minimum difference of 1 (6 - 5 = 1).
The maximum possible minimum difference is 1.
```

<details>
<summary><b>üìñ Example Breakdown</b></summary>
<div>

Let's break down the first example: `arr[] = [2, 6, 2, 5], k = 3`.

1.  **Goal**: We need to pick 3 elements from the array to maximize the smallest gap between any two chosen elements.
2.  **Sort the Array**: To easily calculate differences, let's sort the array first.
    `arr` becomes `[2, 2, 5, 6]`.
3.  **Possible Selections of 3 elements**:
    - `{2, 2, 5}` -> Differences are `(2-2)=0`, `(5-2)=3`. The minimum difference is **0**.
    - `{2, 2, 6}` -> Differences are `(2-2)=0`, `(6-2)=4`. The minimum difference is **0**.
    - `{2, 5, 6}` -> Differences are `(5-2)=3`, `(6-5)=1`. The minimum difference is **1**.
    - `{2, 5, 6}` -> (Using the other '2') Same as above. The minimum difference is **1**.
4.  **Compare Minimums**: The minimum differences we found are `0` and `1`.
5.  **Maximize the Minimum**: The largest of these minimums is **1**.

Therefore, the output is `1`. The core idea is to find the best possible arrangement (`{2, 5, 6}`) that keeps the elements as far apart as possible, maximizing the smallest gap.

</div>
</details>

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 9, 0, 2, 13, 3], k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
Selecting {0, 4, 9, 13} will result in a minimum difference of 4 (4-0=4, 9-4=5, 13-9=4), which is the largest minimum difference possible.
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Constraints

- `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5`
- `0 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^6`
- `2 ‚â§ k ‚â§ arr.size()`

## üí° Solution Approaches

### Optimized Approach: Binary Search on the Answer

The problem asks us to "maximize the minimum," which is a strong indicator that we can use **Binary Search on the Answer**.

The core idea is to guess a potential minimum difference (`mid`) and then check if it's possible to select `k` elements from the array, all having at least this `mid` difference.

- If it's **possible** to achieve a minimum difference of `mid`, it means we might be able to do even better. So, we try for a larger difference (`low = mid + 1`).
- If it's **not possible**, our guess `mid` was too ambitious. We need to try a smaller difference (`high = mid - 1`).

This check is possible because of the monotonic nature of the problem: if we can place `k` elements with a minimum distance `d`, we can definitely place them with any distance smaller than `d`. This allows binary search to work efficiently.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem asks to "maximize the minimum difference," which is a classic pattern for Binary Search on the Answer. We can guess a potential minimum difference and then check if it's feasible to select 'k' elements with that difference.
// Approach:
// 1. Sort the input array. This helps in greedily picking elements.
// 2. Define a search space for the answer. The minimum possible difference is 0, and the maximum is `arr.back() - arr.front()`.
// 3. Apply binary search on this range. For each `mid` value (our guessed minimum difference):
//    a. Use a helper function `isPossible` to check if we can select 'k' elements such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is at least `mid`.
//    b. The check is done greedily: pick the first element, then iterate through the array and pick the next element that is at least `mid` distance away from the previously picked one.
// 4. If `isPossible(mid)` is true, it means `mid` is a valid minimum difference. We store it and try for a larger difference (i.e., `low = mid + 1`).
// 5. If it's false, `mid` is too large, so we reduce our search space (`high = mid - 1`).
// 6. The final stored answer will be the maximum possible minimum difference.
// Time Complexity: O(N log(max_diff)), where N is the number of elements and max_diff is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Sorting takes O(N log N), and the binary search performs log(max_diff) iterations, with each `isPossible` check taking O(N).
// Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size (sorting might take O(log N) for recursion stack, but is often considered in-place).

class Solution {
  public:
    // Helper function to check if it's possible to place 'k' elements
    // with a minimum difference of at least 'mid'.
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& arr, int k, int mid){
        int count = 1;      // We always place the first element.
        int last = arr[0];  // Position of the last placed element.

        // Greedily check for the next valid position.
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] - last >= mid) { // If the gap is sufficient
                count++;            // Place another element.
                last = arr[i];      // Update the last placed position.
            }
            if (count == k) {       // If we have placed 'k' elements
                return true;        // It's possible.
            }
        }

        return false; // Not possible to place 'k' elements.
    }

    int maxMinDiff(vector<int>& arr, int k){
        // Sort the array to easily find differences.
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        // Define the binary search range for the answer.
        int low = 0; // Minimum possible difference
        int high = arr.back() - arr.front(); // Maximum possible difference
        int answer = 0;

        // Binary search to find the maximum valid minimum difference.
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Avoid potential overflow

            // Check if a difference of 'mid' is achievable.
            if (isPossible(arr, k, mid)) {
                answer = mid;       // 'mid' is a possible answer, store it.
                low = mid + 1;      // Try for a larger minimum difference.
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;     // 'mid' is too large, try a smaller one.
            }
        }

        // Return the maximum feasible minimum difference found.
        return answer;
    }
};

#### Java Solution

```java
// Intuition: This problem fits the "maximize the minimum" pattern, making it a perfect candidate for Binary Search on the Answer. The idea is to binary search for the maximum possible minimum difference.
// Approach:
// 1. Sort the array. This allows us to greedily pick elements that are spaced out.
// 2. Set up a search range for the answer. The lowest possible difference is 0, and the highest is `arr[n-1] - arr[0]`.
// 3. In each step of the binary search, we take a `mid` value and check if it's possible to select 'k' elements with at least `mid` difference between them using a helper `isPossible` function.
// 4. The `isPossible` function works greedily. It always selects the first element. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, selecting the next element only if its distance from the previously selected element is `mid` or greater.
// 5. If `isPossible(mid)` returns true, it means `mid` is a potential answer, so we store it and search for a larger difference in the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).
// 6. If it returns false, `mid` is too large, and we need to search for a smaller difference in the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).
// 7. The loop continues until `low` crosses `high`, and the last successfully stored `mid` is our answer.
// Time Complexity: O(N log(max_diff)), dominated by sorting O(N log N) and binary search O(N * log(max_diff)).
// Space Complexity: O(1) (or O(log N) for recursion stack in sorting).

class Solution {
    // Checks if it's possible to pick k elements with at least 'mid' difference.
    static boolean isPossible(int[] arr, int k, int mid) {
        int count = 1;      // Start by placing the first element.
        int last = arr[0];  // Keep track of the last element's value.

        // Iterate through the array to find the next valid element to place.
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // If the current element is far enough from the last one.
            if (arr[i] - last >= mid) {
                count++;        // Increment the count of placed elements.
                last = arr[i];  // Update the last placed element.

        Arrays.sort(arr);

        int low = 0;
        int high = arr[arr.length - 1] - arr[0];
        int answer = 0;

                low = mid + 1;      // Try for an even larger difference.
            } else {

## üöÄ Key Insights

- **Monotonic Search Space**: The core of this problem is recognizing the monotonic property of the `isPossible(d)` function. If you can select `k` elements with a minimum difference of `d`, you can also do it for any difference less than `d`. This allows the "Binary Search on Answer" technique to be applied.
- **Greedy Choice**: After sorting the array, the check (`isPossible`) can be performed greedily. By always picking the first available element that satisfies the minimum difference constraint, you maximize your chances of fitting the remaining `k-1` elements.
