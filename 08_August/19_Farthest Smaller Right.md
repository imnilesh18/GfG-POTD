## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]`. For each element at index `i` (0-based indexing), find the **farthest index** `j` to the right (i.e., `j > i`) such that `arr[j] < arr[i]`. If no such index exists for a given position, return `-1` for that index. Return the resulting array of answers.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 1, 3, 2]
Output: [2, 4, -1, 4, -1]
```
<details>
<summary>üìñ Example Breakdown</summary>

* `arr[0] = 2`: The elements to the right are `[5, 1, 3, 2]`. The smaller elements are `1`. The index of `1` is `2`. So, the answer is `2`.
* `arr[1] = 5`: The elements to the right are `[1, 3, 2]`. Smaller elements are `1`, `3`, `2`. Their indices are `2`, `3`, `4`. The farthest index is `4`.
* `arr[2] = 1`: The elements to the right are `[3, 2]`. No smaller element exists. So, the answer is `-1`.
* `arr[3] = 3`: The elements to the right are `[2]`. The smaller element is `2` at index `4`.
* `arr[4] = 2`: No elements to the right. So, the answer is `-1`.
</details>

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1] 
Output: [4, 4, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: arr[4] is the farthest smallest element to the right for arr[0], arr[1], arr[2] and arr[3].
```

## Solution Approach

### Optimized Approach (Suffix Min + Binary Search)

The core idea is to efficiently find the farthest smaller element for each number. A brute-force check would be O(N¬≤), which is too slow given the constraints.

We can optimize this by pre-calculating the minimum value for every suffix of the array. Let's call this the `suff` array, where `suff[i]` holds the minimum value from `arr[i]` to `arr[n-1]`. This `suff` array will be monotonically non-increasing.

Because the `suff` array is sorted in a non-increasing manner, we can use **Binary Search** on it. For each element `arr[i]`, we can binary search on the `suff` array from index `i+1` to `n-1` to find the rightmost (farthest) index `j` where `suff[j] < arr[i]`. This condition guarantees that there is at least one element at or after index `j` that is smaller than `arr[i]`, and by pushing our binary search to the right, we find the farthest such possibility.

This approach breaks the problem into two parts:
1.  **Preprocessing:** Build the suffix minimum array in O(N) time.
2.  **Searching:** For each of the N elements, perform a binary search O(log N) on the suffix array.

The total time complexity is O(N log N) with O(N) auxiliary space.

### C++ Solution
```cpp
// Intuition: To find the farthest smaller element to the right for arr[i], we need an efficient way to query the minimums in the subarray arr[i+1...n-1].
// A suffix minimum array helps. suff[j] = min(arr[j...n-1]). This array is non-increasing, allowing binary search.
// Approach:
// 1. Pre-compute a suffix minimum array `suff`. `suff[i]` will store the minimum element from index `i` to `n-1`.
// 2. Iterate through the input array from `i = 0` to `n-1`.
// 3. For each `arr[i]`, perform a binary search on the `suff` array in the range `[i+1, n-1]`.
// 4. We want the farthest index `j` where `suff[j] < arr[i]`. So in binary search, if we find such a `mid`, we store it and try to find an even farther one by searching in the right half (`lo = mid + 1`).
// 5. If `suff[mid] >= arr[i]`, we search in the left half (`hi = mid - 1`).
// 6. The result of the binary search for each `i` is the answer for that index.
// Time Complexity: O(N log N), where N is the size of the array. O(N) for building the suffix min array and O(N*logN) for performing binary search for each element.
// Space Complexity: O(N) for storing the suffix minimum array `suff` and the answer array `ans`.
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> farMin(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, -1); // Initialize answer array with -1
    
        // build suffix min array
        vector<int> suff(n);
        suff[n - 1] = arr[n - 1]; // The last element is the min of the last suffix
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            suff[i] = min(arr[i], suff[i + 1]); // Each suffix min is the minimum of current element and the next suffix min
    
        // binary search on suffix for farthest smaller element
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int lo = i + 1, hi = n - 1, res = -1; // Search range is to the right of i
    
            while (lo <= hi) {
                int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2; // Avoid potential overflow
                if (suff[mid] < arr[i]) {
                    res = mid;      // Found a potential answer, store it
                    lo = mid + 1;   // Try to find a farther index to the right
                } else {
                    hi = mid - 1;   // Suffix min is not smaller, search in the left half
                }
            }
    
            ans[i] = res; // Store the farthest index found
        }
    
        return ans;
    }
};

### Java Solution

```java
// Intuition: The problem asks for the farthest index `j > i` with `arr[j] < arr[i]`. A naive O(N^2) approach would be too slow. We can optimize by preprocessing.
// A suffix minimum array `suff` where `suff[k]` is the minimum of `arr[k...n-1]` is useful. This `suff` array is non-increasing, which is perfect for binary search.
// Approach:
// 1. Create a suffix minimum array `suff`. This is done by iterating from right-to-left. `suff[i] = min(arr[i], suff[i+1])`.
// 2. Iterate through the array with index `i`.
// 3. For each `arr[i]`, we need to find the largest `j` in `[i+1, n-1]` such that `arr[j] < arr[i]`.
// 4. This is equivalent to finding the largest `j` such that `suff[j] < arr[i]`.
// 5. We can binary search for this `j` on the `suff` array. If `suff[mid] < arr[i]`, we have a potential answer, so we record `mid` and search for a farther one in the right half `[mid+1, hi]`.
// 6. Otherwise, we search in the left half `[lo, mid-1]`.
// Time Complexity: O(N log N) - O(N) to build the suffix array and O(log N) for each of the N elements.
// Space Complexity: O(N) - For the suffix array and the answer list.
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> farMin(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        // Initialize the answer list with -1
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(n, -1));
        ArrayList<Integer> arrList = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i : arr) arrList.add(i);

        // build suffix min array
        ArrayList<Integer> suff = new ArrayList<>(arrList);
        // The last element is the base case
        suff.set(n - 1, arrList.get(n - 1));
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i)
            // Calculate suffix min from right to left
            suff.set(i, Math.min(arrList.get(i), suff.get(i + 1)));

        // binary search on suffix for farthest smaller element
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int lo = i + 1, hi = n - 1, res = -1; // Search space is to the right of `i`

            while (lo <= hi) {
                int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
                // If the minimum in the suffix from `mid` is smaller than arr[i]
                if (suff.get(mid) < arrList.get(i)) {
                    res = mid;       // This is a potential answer
                    lo = mid + 1;    // Check if a farther index exists on the right
                } else {
                    hi = mid - 1;    // Otherwise, search on the left
                }
            }

            ans.set(i, res); // Set the farthest index found

## Key Insights

The problem becomes much simpler once we change our perspective. Instead of asking "for `arr[i]`, what is the farthest smaller element?", we can ask "for `arr[i]`, what is the farthest point `j` where the *minimum* from `j` onwards is smaller than `arr[i]`?".

The **suffix minimum array** provides this information efficiently. Its non-increasing (sorted) nature is the key property that unlocks the O(log N) binary search, leading to an overall O(N log N) solution.
