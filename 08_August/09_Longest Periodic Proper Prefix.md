## üìù Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest periodic proper prefix** of `s`. If no such prefix exists, return `-1`.

A **periodic proper prefix** is a non-empty prefix of `s` (but not the whole string), such that repeating this prefix enough times produces a string that _starts_ with `s`.

---

## üß™ Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "aaaaaa"
Output: 5
Explanation:
The proper prefix "aaaaa" (length 5) is periodic.
Repeating it gives "aaaaa" + "aaaaa" = "aaaaaaaaaa...".
The original string "aaaaaa" is a prefix of this repeated string.
No longer proper prefix satisfies this condition.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "abcab"
Output: 3
Explanation:
Repeating the proper prefix "abc" (length 3) forms "abcabc...", which contains "abcab" as a prefix.
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example 2 Breakdown</summary>

Let's walk through `s = "abcab"`:

1.  **Identify Proper Prefixes:**

    - `a` (length 1)
    - `ab` (length 2)
    - `abc` (length 3)
    - `abca` (length 4)

2.  **Test Each Prefix for Periodicity:**

    - **Prefix "a"**: Repeating it gives `"aaaaa..."`. Is `"abcab"` a prefix of `"aaaaa..."`? No.
    - **Prefix "ab"**: Repeating it gives `"ababab..."`. Is `"abcab"` a prefix of `"ababab..."`? No.
    - **Prefix "abc"**: Repeating it gives `"abcabc..."`. Is `"abcab"` a prefix of `"abcabc..."`? Yes. This is a valid periodic proper prefix of length 3.
    - **Prefix "abca"**: Repeating it gives `"abcaabca..."`. Is `"abcab"` a prefix of `"abcaabca..."`? No.

3.  **Find the Longest:**
    - The only valid periodic proper prefix we found is `"abc"` with length `3`.
    - Therefore, the answer is `3`.

</details>

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "ababd"
Output: -1
Explanation:
No proper prefix satisfies the given condition. For example, repeating "ab" gives "ababab...", and "ababd" is not a prefix of it.
```

## üí° Solution Approaches

### Optimized Approach: Z-Algorithm

The core idea is to use the **Z-Algorithm**, which efficiently computes a Z-array. The Z-array `z` for a string `s` of length `n` is an array where `z[i]` is the length of the longest substring starting from `s[i]` that is also a prefix of `s`.

A proper prefix of length `L` is periodic if the rest of the string `s[L:]` is a prefix of the original string `s`. This condition can be checked using the Z-array: `z[L] >= n - L`.

To find the _longest_ such prefix, we can check this condition by iterating `i` from `n-1` down to `1`. The first `i` that satisfies `z[i] == n - i` gives us the length of the longest periodic proper prefix. This is because `z[i] == n - i` implies that the suffix `s[i:]` (length `n-i`) is _exactly_ equal to the prefix `s[0:n-i]`. This structure guarantees that the prefix `s[0:i]` is periodic.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem asks for a prefix P such that S is a prefix of P+P+P...
// This is equivalent to finding the largest proper prefix P = s[0...i-1] where the remaining part of the string s[i...n-1] is a prefix of P.
// The Z-algorithm helps identify substrings that are also prefixes of the main string.
//
// Approach:
// 1. Compute the Z-array for the input string 's'.
// 2. The Z-array element z[i] stores the length of the longest substring starting at index 'i' that matches the prefix of 's'.
// 3. We are looking for the largest 'i' (where i is the length of the prefix) such that the suffix s[i:] is a prefix of s.
// 4. This condition is perfectly captured by checking if z[i] == n - i. This means the substring from 'i' to the end matches the prefix of 's' of the same length.
// 5. We iterate from the end of the string (i = n - 1) down to 1 to find the largest such 'i'.
// 6. The first 'i' that satisfies the condition is our answer. If no such 'i' is found, it means no such prefix exists, so we return -1.
//
// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. The Z-algorithm runs in linear time.
// Space Complexity: O(n) to store the Z-array.

class Solution {
 public:
    // Function to compute the Z-array for a string.
    // z[i] = length of the longest substring starting at s[i] that is also a prefix of s.
    vector<int> zFunction(string &s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);

        // [l, r] defines the current "Z-box", a window that matches a prefix of s.
        for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            // If i is inside the current Z-box, we can initialize z[i] smartly.
            if (i <= r) {
                // z[i] is at least the minimum of the remaining length of the box and the pre-computed value.
                z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
            }
            // Try to extend the match character by character.
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            // If the current match extends beyond the old Z-box, update the box boundaries.
            if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i] - 1;
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

    int getLongestPrefix(string &s) {
        int n = s.size();
        if (n <= 1) return -1; // A proper prefix must exist.

        // Compute the Z-array for the string.
        vector<int> z = zFunction(s);

        // Traverse the Z-array from the end to find the longest proper prefix.
        // We look for a position 'i' where the suffix s[i:] is identical to the prefix s[0:n-i].
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // The condition z[i] == n - i confirms that the suffix of length (n-i)
            // starting at index 'i' is exactly equal to the prefix of the same length.
            // This means the prefix of length 'i' is periodic.
            if (z[i] == n - i) {
                return i; // Found the longest one, so return its length.
            }
        }

        // If the loop completes, no such periodic proper prefix was found.
        return -1;
    }
};

## üéØ Key Insights

The Z-algorithm provides a powerful and linear-time solution for a problem that seems to require complex pattern matching. The key insight is translating the problem's definition of a "periodic proper prefix" into a concrete, checkable condition using the Z-array.

The condition `z[i] == n - i` is a clever way to verify periodicity. It confirms that the string `s` is composed of a prefix `P = s[0:i]` followed by a suffix that is identical to the beginning of `P`. This structure `s = P_start + P_start_prefix` is precisely what allows `P` to generate `s` when repeated.
