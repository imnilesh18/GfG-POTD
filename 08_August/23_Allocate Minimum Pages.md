## üìÑ Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of integers, where each element `arr[i]` represents the number of pages in the i-th book. You also have an integer `k` representing the number of students. The task is to allocate books to each student such that:

1.  Each student receives at least one book.
2.  Each student is assigned a **contiguous** sequence of books.
3.  No book is assigned to more than one student.

The objective is to **minimize the maximum number of pages** assigned to any student. In other words, out of all possible allocations, find the arrangement where the student who receives the most pages still has the smallest possible maximum.

**Note**: If it is not possible to allocate books to all students, return `-1`.

---

## üìñ Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input:
arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90]
k = 2

Output: 113

Explanation:
Allocation can be done in the following ways:
=> [12] and [34, 67, 90] -> Maximum Pages = 191
=> [12, 34] and [67, 90] -> Maximum Pages = 157
=> [12, 34, 67] and [90] -> Maximum Pages = 113

The third combination has the minimum possible maximum pages, which is 113.
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example 1 Breakdown</summary>

Let's walk through `arr[] = [12, 34, 67, 90]` and `k = 2`.

- **Goal**: We want to split the array into 2 contiguous parts and find the split where the largest sum of any part is minimized.
- **Possible Splits:**
  1.  `(12)` and `(34, 67, 90)`
      - Sums: `12` and `191`
      - Max sum for this split: `191`
  2.  `(12, 34)` and `(67, 90)`
      - Sums: `46` and `157`
      - Max sum for this split: `157`
  3.  `(12, 34, 67)` and `(90)`
      - Sums: `113` and `90`
      - Max sum for this split: `113`
- **Comparing Maximums**: The maximums we found are `191`, `157`, and `113`.
- **Result**: The minimum of these maximums is **113**.

</details>

### Example 2:

```
Input:
arr[] = [15, 17, 20]
k = 5

Output: -1

Explanation:
Since there are more students (5) than total books (3), it's impossible to allocate at least one book to each student.
```

## üí° Solution Approaches

The problem asks to minimize a maximum value, which is a classic signal for **Binary Search on the Answer**.

### Intuition

The answer (the minimum possible maximum pages for any student) must lie within a specific range.

- The **minimum** possible value (`low`) is the largest number of pages in a single book (since that book must be assigned to someone).
- The **maximum** possible value (`high`) is the sum of all pages in all books (the case where one student gets all books).

We can binary search within this `[low, high]` range. For any `mid` value (a potential answer), we need a way to check if it's possible to allocate books to `k` students such that no student gets more than `mid` pages.

If it's possible with `mid` pages, it means we might be able to do even better, so we try a smaller value by setting `high = mid - 1`. If it's not possible, `mid` is too small, and we need to allow more pages, so we set `low = mid + 1`.

### Optimized Approach: Binary Search

A helper function, `check()`, greedily determines if an allocation is possible for a given page limit. It iterates through the books, summing up pages for the current student. Once the sum exceeds the limit, it assigns the current book to a new student and increments the student count. If the total students required are less than or equal to `k`, the limit is feasible.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem asks for the minimum of a maximum value, which suggests binary search on the answer. The search space for the answer (maximum pages per student) ranges from the max pages of a single book to the sum of all pages.
// Approach:
// 1. Define a search space `[lo, hi]`, where `lo` is the maximum element in `arr` and `hi` is the sum of all elements.
// 2. Perform binary search on this range. For each `mid`, check if it's a feasible maximum page limit for `k` students using a helper function `check()`.
// 3. The `check()` function greedily allocates books to students. It keeps adding pages to the current student until it exceeds `mid`. Then, it moves to the next student.
// 4. If `check(mid)` returns true (meaning an allocation is possible with `mid` as the limit), it means `mid` could be our answer, so we try for a smaller value: `res = mid`, `hi = mid - 1`.
// 5. If `check(mid)` is false, the limit is too small, so we must increase it: `lo = mid + 1`.
// 6. The final `res` will hold the minimum possible maximum.
// Time Complexity: O(N * log(Sum - Max)), where N is the number of books, Sum is the total pages, and Max is the max pages in a book. The binary search runs in O(log(Sum - Max)) and the `check` function takes O(N).
// Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.
class Solution {
  public:
    // function to check if books can be allocated to
    // all k students without exceeding 'pageLimit'
    bool check(vector<int> &arr, int k, int pageLimit) {

        // starting from the first student
        int cnt = 1;
        int pageSum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {

            // if adding the current book exceeds the page
            // limit, assign the book to the next student
            if(pageSum + arr[i] > pageLimit) {
                cnt++; // increment student count
                pageSum = arr[i]; // start new sum for the new student
            }
            else {
                // otherwise, add pages to the current student
                pageSum += arr[i];
            }
        }

        // if the number of students required is within the limit k, it's a valid allocation
        return (cnt <= k);
    }

    int findPages(vector<int> &arr, int k) {

        // if number of students are more than total books, allocation is not possible
        if(k > arr.size())
            return -1;

        // search space for Binary Search
        // 'lo' is the minimum possible answer (max pages in a single book)
        int lo = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        // 'hi' is the maximum possible answer (sum of all pages)
        int hi = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
        int res = -1;

        // standard binary search loop
        while(lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo)/2;

            // check if 'mid' is a feasible page limit
            if(check(arr, k, mid)){
                res = mid;      // store potential answer
                hi = mid - 1;   // try for a smaller maximum
            }
            else {
                lo = mid + 1;   // 'mid' is too small, increase the limit
            }
        }

        return res;
    }

#### Java Solution

```java
// Intuition: The problem requires finding the minimum possible value for the maximum number of pages assigned to a student. This structure suggests a binary search approach on the potential answers for this minimum-maximum value.
// Approach:
// 1. Establish a search range for the answer. The lower bound `lo` is the maximum pages in any single book, and the upper bound `hi` is the sum of all pages.
// 2. Apply binary search. For each `mid` value, use a helper function `check()` to verify if it's possible to distribute books among `k` students without any student exceeding the `mid` page limit.
// 3. The `check()` function greedily assigns books to the current student until the page count surpasses `mid`, at which point it moves to the next student.
// 4. If `check(mid)` is true, it means `mid` is a valid potential answer. We then try to find an even smaller value by setting `res = mid` and `hi = mid - 1`.
// 5. If `check(mid)` is false, `mid` is too restrictive, and we must allow more pages by setting `lo = mid + 1`.
// 6. The loop continues until `lo` crosses `hi`, and `res` will hold the minimal maximum value found.
// Time Complexity: O(N * log(Sum - Max)), where N is the number of books. The binary search takes O(log(Sum - Max)) iterations, and each call to `check` is O(N).
// Space Complexity: O(1), as no auxiliary data structures are used.

## üöÄ Key Insights

- **Monotonicity**: The core principle that enables binary search here is the monotonic nature of the `check(pageLimit)` function. If we can successfully allocate books with a maximum limit of `X` pages, we can **definitely** also do it with any limit `Y > X`. Conversely, if we cannot make an allocation with limit `X`, we **definitely** cannot do it with any limit `Z < X`. This property ensures that our binary search correctly narrows down the search space to find the optimal minimum-maximum value.
- **Greedy Check**: The `check` function works because the books must be allocated contiguously. For a given page limit, the most optimal strategy to minimize the number of students is to be greedy: assign as many books as possible to the current student before moving to the next one.
