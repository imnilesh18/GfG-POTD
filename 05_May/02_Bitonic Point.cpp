 *
 * Given an array of integers arr[] that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the bitonic point, that is the maximum element in the array.
 * Bitonic Point is a point before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing.
 *
 * Note: It is guaranteed that the array contains exactly one bitonic point.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: Elements before 8 are strictly increasing [1, 2, 4, 5, 7] and elements after 8 are strictly decreasing [3].
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
 * Output: 50
 * Explanation: Elements before 50 are strictly increasing [10, 20, 30 40] and there are no elements after 50.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [120, 100, 80, 20, 0]
 * Output: 120
 * Explanation: There are no elements before 120 and elements after 120 are strictly decreasing [100, 80, 20, 0].
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 3 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
 * 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6

// Intuition:

/*
 * A Bitonic array is one that increases strictly to a point and then strictly decreases.
 * The point where the array changes direction (from increasing to decreasing) is called the Bitonic Point (Peak).
 * Since the array increases and then decreases, the peak element is greater than its neighbors.
 * We can use binary search to efficiently find this peak element by checking mid and its neighbors.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3]
 * Step 1: low = 1, high = 5 (excluding first and last which are edge cases)
 * Step 2: mid = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3 → arr[3] = 5
 *         → arr[3] < arr[4] → Move right → low = 4
 * Step 3: mid = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4 → arr[4] = 7
 *         → arr[4] < arr[5] → Move right → low = 5
 * Step 4: mid = 5 → arr[5] = 8
 *         → arr[5] > arr[4] && arr[5] > arr[6] → Peak found → return 8
 *
 * Conclusion:
 * By checking the relationship between mid and its neighbors, we can keep narrowing the search space.
 * This guarantees an O(log n) time complexity for finding the Bitonic Point.
