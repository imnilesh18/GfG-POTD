## Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `arr[]` (containing only `0`'s and `1`'s) and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can select a contiguous subarray of length `k` and **flip all its bits** (i.e., change every `0` to `1` and every `1` to `0`).

Your task is to find the **minimum** number of such operations required to make the entire array consist of only `1`'s. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
1. Select subarray [2, 3] and flip: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
2. Select subarray [4, 5] and flip: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
3. Select subarray [5, 6] and flip: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
4. Select subarray [6, 7] and flip: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

<summary>üìñ Example Breakdown</summary>

Let's walk through the first example: `arr = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`, `k = 2`.

- We iterate from left to right. The first `0` is at index `2`.
- We **must** flip the subarray of length `k=2` starting at index `2`. If we don't, this `0` will never be flipped to a `1` because our window only moves forward.
- **Flip 1 (indices 2-3):**
  - `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - We have performed `1` flip.
- The next `0` is at index `4`.
- **Flip 2 (indices 4-5):**
  - `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Total flips: `2`.
- The next `0` is at index `5`.
- **Flip 3 (indices 5-6):**
  - `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Total flips: `3`.
- The next `0` is at index `6`.
- **Flip 4 (indices 6-7):**
  - `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Total flips: `4`.
- The array is now all `1`s. The minimum number of operations is `4`.

</details>

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to convert all elements to 1's. After flipping from the first 0, we reach a state where the last few elements are 0, and we cannot start a flip that stays within bounds.
```

## Constraints

- `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^6`
- `1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ arr.size()`

## Solution Approaches

### Optimized Greedy Approach (Sliding Window)

The core idea is to use a greedy strategy. When we encounter a `0`, we must perform a flip operation starting at that index. Why? Because this is our only chance to turn this `0` into a `1`. Any future flip operation starting at a later index won't affect the current position.

To implement this efficiently without repeatedly flipping subarrays (which would be `O(N*K)`), we can use a clever trick. Instead of actually flipping the values, we can track the "effect" of past flips on the current element.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: A greedy approach works best. When we see a '0', we must flip the next 'k' bits to make the current bit '1'.
// This is our only chance to fix the current bit, as future flips won't affect it. We can track the number of active flips
// affecting the current element to determine its effective value without modifying the array multiple times.

// Approach: We iterate through the array, maintaining a count `current_active_flips`. This count represents how many
// past flip operations are currently "active" and affecting the current index `i`.
// 1. If we are at index `i`, any flip that started at `i-k` is now out of range. So we decrement `current_active_flips`
//    if a flip was initiated at `i-k`. We use the array itself to mark this, by adding 2 to `arr[i-k]`.
// 2. We check the effective value of `arr[i]`. If `(arr[i] + current_active_flips)` is even, it means the effective
//    value is 0 (since 0+even=even, 1+odd=even).
// 3. If the effective value is 0, we must perform a flip. We increment `total_flips` and `current_active_flips`.
//    To mark that a flip started here, we add 2 to `arr[i]`. This preserves the original parity (0->2, 1->3) while marking.
// 4. If a required flip would go out of bounds (i.e., `i + k > n`), it's impossible, so we return -1.

// Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the array. We iterate through the array once.
// Space Complexity: O(1), as we modify the input array in place to store flip information, using no extra space.

## Key Insights

- **Greedy Choice**: The key insight is that the decision to flip at any index `i` is determined solely by the state of `arr[i]`. If it's a `0` (or its effective value is `0`), we *must* flip. This greedy choice doesn't negatively impact future decisions because it's the only opportunity to fix the current bit.
- **State Tracking with O(1) Space**: The brilliant part of the optimized solution is avoiding the use of an extra queue or array to track active flips. By modifying the input array `arr` (e.g., by adding 2), we can mark the start of a flip operation. This lets us know when to "deactivate" a flip's effect as our sliding window moves past it, achieving a constant space complexity.
