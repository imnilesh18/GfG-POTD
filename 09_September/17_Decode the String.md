## Problem Statement

Given an encoded string `s`, decode it by expanding the pattern `k[substring]`, where the substring inside brackets is written `k` times. `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer, and `encodedString` contains only lowercase English alphabets.

Return the final decoded string.

**Note:** The test cases are generated so that the length of the output string will never exceed 10<sup>5</sup>.

## Examples

**Input:**

```
s = "3[b2[ca]]"
```

**Output:**

```
"bcacabcacabcaca"
```

**Explanation:**
Inner substring ‚Äú2[ca]‚Äù breakdown into ‚Äúcaca‚Äù.
Now, new string becomes ‚Äú3[bcaca]‚Äù
Similarly ‚Äú3[bcaca]‚Äù becomes ‚Äúbcacabcacabcaca‚Äù which is final result.

<br>

**Input:**

```
s = "3[ab]"
```

**Output:**

```
"ababab"
```

**Explanation:**
The substring "ab" is repeated 3 times giving "ababab".

<summary><b>üìñ Example 1 Breakdown (Walkthrough)</b></summary>

Let's trace `s = "3[b2[ca]]"`:

1.  We start parsing. We see `3`. This is our multiplier `k`.
2.  We hit `[`. This means we must save the multiplier (3) and the string we've built so far (which is "") onto stacks. We reset to handle the inner content.
3.  We see `b`. We append it to our _new_ current string. `current = "b"`.
4.  We see `2`. This is a new multiplier for the _next_ level.
5.  We hit `[`. We must save our current state again.
    - Push multiplier (2) to the number stack.
    - Push the string ("b") to the string stack.
    - Reset `current` to "".
6.  We see `c`. Append it. `current = "c"`.
7.  We see `a`. Append it. `current = "ca"`.
8.  We hit `]`. This closes the _inner_ scope.
    - Pop the multiplier: `repeatTimes = 2`.
    - Pop the previous string: `decoded = "b"`.
    - Repeat the _current_ string ("ca") 2 times ("caca") and append it to the popped string ("b").
    - Update `current` = "b" + "caca" = "bcaca".
9.  We hit the final `]`. This closes the _outer_ scope.
    - Pop the multiplier: `repeatTimes = 3`.
    - Pop the previous string: `decoded = ""` (the initial empty string).
    - Repeat the _current_ string ("bcaca") 3 times.
    - Update `current` = "" + "bcacabcacabcaca".
10. We finish the loop. Final result: `bcacabcacabcaca`.

## üöÄ Solution Approaches

The problem has a clear nested, recursive structure, making it a perfect candidate for a **Stack-based solution**. When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it signals the start of a new, nested "job." We need to save the state of our _current_ job (the multiplier we just saw and the string we built _before_ this bracket) and start the new one. When we hit a closing bracket `]`, the nested job is done, and we can "restore" our previous job, merging the results.

### Optimized Approach: Iterative (Two Stacks)

We use two stacks: one for numbers (`numStack`) and one for strings (`strStack`).

1.  Iterate through the string `s` character by character.
2.  If `c` is a digit: Update the current multiplier `k` (handling multi-digit numbers like "12" by using `k = k * 10 + ...`).
3.  If `c` is `[`: Push the _current_ `k` onto `numStack` and the _current_ string onto `strStack`. Reset `k = 0` and `current = ""` to start building the new nested substring.
4.  If `c` is `]`: This signifies the end of a nested segment.
    - Pop the multiplier `repeatTimes` from `numStack`.
    - Pop the `decoded` (previous) string from `strStack`.
    - Append the _current_ string to `decoded` `repeatTimes` times.
    - Set this newly formed string (`decoded`) as the _new_ `current` string.
5.  If `c` is an alphabet char: Append it to the `current` string.
6.  The final `current` string after the loop is the answer.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem has a recursive structure (patterns within patterns). A stack is the natural data structure
// to manage this nested context iteratively, saving the state (multiplier and previous string) before starting a new sub-problem.
// Approach: Use two stacks (one for numbers and one for strings) to iteratively build the decoded string.
//   1. Iterate character by character.
//   2. If digit: Build the multiplier k (handles multiple digits like '12').
//   3. If '[': Push k onto numStack, push the 'current' string onto strStack. Reset k=0 and current="".
//   4. If ']': Pop repeat count (k) from numStack, pop previous string (prev) from strStack.
//   5.          Create the new string by appending the 'current' (nested) string to 'prev', k times. Update 'current' to this new string.
//   6. If alphabet: Append char to 'current'.
//   7. After the loop, 'current' holds the final decoded string.
// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string 's'. Each character is processed once (pushed/popped onto stacks in O(1) or appended).
// Space Complexity: O(n). In the worst case (e.g., "1[1[1[1[a]]]]"), the stacks store a significant portion of the input string segments.
class Solution {
public:
    string decodedString(string& s) {
      stack<int>    numStack;       // Stack to store multipliers.
      stack<string> strStack;       // Stack to store the strings built so far (the context before '[').
      string        current;        // Current substring being built (inside the most recent '[').
      int           k = 0;          // Current multiplier.

      for (char c : s) {
          if (isdigit(c)) {
              // Build the multiplier k (handles multiple digits, e.g., "12[a]").
              k = k * 10 + (c - '0');
          } else if (c == '[') {
              // Save state: Push the current multiplier and the string built *so far* onto their stacks.
              numStack.push(k);
              strStack.push(current);

              // Reset k and current for the new *nested* substring we are about to build.
              k       = 0;
              current = "";
          } else if (c == ']') {
              // End of a segment. Time to decode and merge.
              int repeatTimes = numStack.top(); // Get how many times this segment repeats.
              numStack.pop();
              string decoded = strStack.top(); // Get the string context *before* this segment started.
              strStack.pop();

              // Append the current substring (e.g., "ca") repeated repeatTimes (e.g., 2)
              // to the decoded string (e.g., "b").
              while (repeatTimes--) {
                  decoded += current;
              }
              // This fully decoded segment (e.g., "bcaca") becomes the new "current" string,
              // ready to be appended or used in the next loop iteration (which might be another ']').
              current = decoded;
          } else {
              // Regular alphabet character.
              // Append the current character to the current substring being built.
              current.push_back(c);
          }
      }
      return current; // The final string processed.
    }
};

## üîë Key Insights

The iterative stack approach perfectly mirrors the recursive nature of the problem (often called "Depth-First Search" parsing).

- Pushing onto the stacks (when hitting `[`) is equivalent to making a recursive call (saving the current state before descending).
- Popping from the stacks (when hitting `]`) is equivalent to _returning_ from a recursive call (restoring the previous state and using the returned value).
- This avoids the overhead of the system's call stack in a deep-nested recursion and gives us direct control over the state.
