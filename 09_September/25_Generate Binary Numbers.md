## üéØ Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, the task is to generate all binary numbers with decimal values from `1` to `n`.

---

## üìñ Examples

Here are the sample test cases to illustrate the problem.

<details>
<summary><strong>Example 1</strong></summary>

```
Input: n = 4
Output: ["1", "10", "11", "100"]
Explanation: Binary numbers from 1 to 4 are 1, 10, 11, and 100.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example 2</strong></summary>

```
Input: n = 6
Output: ["1", "10", "11", "100", "101", "110"]
Explanation: Binary numbers from 1 to 6 are 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, and 110.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ Example Breakdown (n = 4)</strong></summary>

Let's walk through the process using a queue:

1.  **Initialize:**

    - `result = []`
    - `queue = ["1"]` (Start with the binary representation of 1)
    - We need to generate 4 numbers.

2.  **Iteration 1 (n=4):**

    - Dequeue `"1"`.
    - Add it to `result`. `result` is now `["1"]`.
    - Generate its children by appending "0" and "1":
      - Enqueue `"10"`.
      - Enqueue `"11"`.
    - `queue` is now `["10", "11"]`.

3.  **Iteration 2 (n=3):**

    - Dequeue `"10"`.
    - Add it to `result`. `result` is now `["1", "10"]`.
    - Generate its children:
      - Enqueue `"100"`.
      - Enqueue `"101"`.
    - `queue` is now `["11", "100", "101"]`.

4.  **Iteration 3 (n=2):**

    - Dequeue `"11"`.
    - Add it to `result`. `result` is now `["1", "10", "11"]`.
    - Generate its children:
      - Enqueue `"110"`.
      - Enqueue `"111"`.
    - `queue` is now `["100", "101", "110", "111"]`.

5.  **Iteration 4 (n=1):**

    - Dequeue `"100"`.
    - Add it to `result`. `result` is now `["1", "10", "11", "100"]`.
    - The loop terminates as we have generated `n` numbers.

6.  **Final Result:** `["1", "10", "11", "100"]`. This level-by-level generation naturally produces the binary numbers in increasing order.

## üí° Solution Approaches

The problem can be efficiently solved using a **Queue** data structure, which leverages a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach.

### Optimized Approach (Using a Queue)

The core idea is to generate binary numbers level by level. We start with "1". In each step, we dequeue a binary number, add it to our result list, and then enqueue two new numbers: the current number with a "0" appended and the current number with a "1" appended. This process naturally generates the numbers in the correct sequence from 1 to `n`.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem can be modeled as a level-order traversal (BFS) of an implicit binary tree. The root is "1". The left child of any node is formed by appending "0" and the right child by appending "1". A queue is perfect for BFS.
// Approach:
// 1. Create a queue of strings and initialize it by pushing "1".
// 2. Create a vector of strings `res` to store the results.
// 3. Loop `n` times:
//    a. Dequeue the front element, let's call it `s1`.
//    b. Add `s1` to the result vector `res`.
//    c. Create a copy of `s1`, let's call it `s2`.
//    d. Append "0" to `s1` and push it into the queue.
//    e. Append "1" to `s2` and push it into the queue.
// 4. Return the result vector.
// Time Complexity: O(n), because we loop `n` times, and each string operation inside the loop is amortized constant time relative to the scale of n.
// Space Complexity: O(n), as the queue can store up to O(n) binary numbers at a time.
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<string> generateBinary(int n){
        vector<string> res; // Vector to store the final binary strings.
        queue<string> q;    // Queue to manage the generation process (BFS).

        // Enqueue the first binary number, which is "1".
        q.push("1");

        // This loop simulates a BFS traversal. It runs n times to generate n binary numbers.
        while (n--) {

            // Dequeue the current binary number string.
            string s1 = q.front();
            q.pop();
            res.push_back(s1); // Add it to our result list.

            string s2 = s1; // Make a copy for appending "1".

            // Check if we still need to generate more numbers to avoid extra pushes.
            if(q.size() < n) {

                // Append "0" to s1 and enqueue it. This is the "left child".
                q.push(s1.append("0"));

                // Append "1" to s2 and enqueue it. This is the "right child".
                q.push(s2.append("1"));
            }
        }
        return res; // Return the collected binary numbers.
    }

    /*
    *
    * Dry Run (n = 4)
    *
    * Initial State:
    * res = []
    * q = ["1"]
    * n = 4

    * q.push(s1 + "0") -> q = ["10"]
    * q.push(s2 + "1") -> q = ["10", "11"]
    *
    * Iteration 2 (n becomes 2):
    * s1 = q.front() -> "10", q.pop() -> q = ["11"]

    * s2 = "10"

    * q.push(s2 + "1") -> q = ["11", "100", "101"]
    *
    * Iteration 3 (n becomes 1):

    * s2 = "11"
    * q.push(s1 + "0") -> q = ["100", "101", "110"]
    * q.push(s2 + "1") -> q = ["100", "101", "110", "111"]
    *
    * Iteration 4 (n becomes 0):
    * s1 = q.front() -> "100", q.pop() -> q = ["101", "110", "111"]
    * res.push_back("100") -> res = ["1", "10", "11", "100"]

## üîë Key Insights

- **BFS for Ordered Generation:** Using a queue (which facilitates BFS) is the key. It ensures that we process numbers level by level (e.g., all 2-digit binary numbers before any 3-digit ones), which naturally generates them in ascending order of their decimal value.
- **Implicit Tree Structure:** The generation process can be visualized as traversing a binary tree that isn't explicitly stored in memory. The node `"s"` has children `"s0"` and `"s1"`. This mental model makes the queue-based approach intuitive.
