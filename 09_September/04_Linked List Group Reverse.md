## Problem Statement

You are given the **head** of a Singly linked list. You have to **reverse** every **k** node in the linked list and return the head of the modified list.

**Note**: If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then the left-out nodes at the end, should be considered as a group and must be **reversed**.

---

## Examples

<details>
<summary><strong>üìñ Example 1 Breakdown</strong></summary>

**Input:**

```
k = 2
Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```

**Output:**

```
2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5
```

**Walkthrough:**

1.  The first group of size `k=2` is `1 -> 2`. After reversing, it becomes `2 -> 1`. The new head of the entire list is now node `2`.
2.  The next group is `3 -> 4`. Reversing it gives `4 -> 3`. We connect the tail of the first group (node `1`) to the head of this new group (node `4`). The list is now `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3`.
3.  The final group is `5 -> 6`. Reversing it gives `6 -> 5`. We connect the tail of the previous group (node `3`) to the head of this group (node `6`).
4.  The final modified list is `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example 2</strong></summary>

**Input:**

```
k = 4
Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```

**Output:**

```
4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5
```

**Explanation:**
The first group `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` is reversed to `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`. The second group `5 -> 6` is smaller than `k`, but it's the last group, so it's also reversed to `6 -> 5`. The two groups are then connected.

## Solution Approaches

### Iterative Approach

The core idea is to traverse the linked list, processing `k` nodes at a time. For each group of `k` nodes, we perform a standard iterative reversal. The key challenge is to correctly link the reversed groups together. We use a `tail` pointer to keep track of the end of the _previously_ reversed group, allowing us to connect it to the head of the _newly_ reversed group.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem requires reversing a linked list in groups of 'k'. The core idea is to iterate through the linked list,
// take 'k' nodes at a time, reverse that group, and then connect it to the previously reversed group.
// Approach:
// 1. Initialize pointers: `curr` to traverse the list, `newHead` to store the final head, and `tail` to connect the reversed groups.
// 2. Use a `while` loop to process the list as long as `curr` is not null.
// 3. Inside the loop, for each group:
//    a. Store the head of the current group (`groupHead`).
//    b. Reverse `k` nodes using the standard iterative reversal method (with `prev`, `curr`, `nextNode`).
//    c. After reversing, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed group.
//    d. If this is the first group (`newHead` is null), set `newHead` to `prev`.
//    e. If it's not the first group, connect the tail of the *previous* group (`tail`) to the head of the *current* reversed group (`prev`).
//    f. Update `tail` to be the end of the current reversed group, which was its original head (`groupHead`).
// 4. Return `newHead`.
// Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited exactly once.
// Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant number of extra pointers.

class Solution {
  public:
    Node *reverseKGroup(Node *head, int k) {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            return head; // Return if the list is empty.
        }

        Node *curr = head;
        Node *newHead = nullptr; // This will become the new head of the modified list.
        Node *tail = nullptr;    // This will point to the tail of the last reversed group.

        while (curr != nullptr) {
            Node *groupHead = curr; // The starting node of the current group.
            Node *prev = nullptr;
            Node *nextNode = nullptr;
            int count = 0;

            // Reverse the nodes in the current group of size up to k.
            while (curr != nullptr && count < k) {
                nextNode = curr->next;
                curr->next = prev;
                prev = curr;
                curr = nextNode;
                count++;
            }

            // If newHead is null, it means this is the first group.
            // Its reversed head (prev) becomes the new head of the entire list.
            if (newHead == nullptr) {
                newHead = prev;
            }

            // Connect the previous group to the current reversed group.
            if (tail != nullptr) {
                tail->next = prev;
            }

            // The tail of the current reversed group is its original head (`groupHead`).
            // Update the main `tail` pointer to this node for the next iteration.
            tail = groupHead;
        }

        return newHead;
    }
};

## Key Insights

- **Group-by-Group Reversal:** The problem is solved by breaking it down into smaller, manageable subproblems: reversing each group of `k` nodes.
- **Connecting the Dots:** The most crucial part of the iterative solution is managing the connections between the reversed groups. The `tail` pointer, which always points to the last node of the most recently processed group, is essential for this.
- **Handling the First Group:** A special check (`if (newHead == nullptr)`) is needed to correctly assign the head of the _first_ reversed group as the new head for the entire list.
- **Final Un-even Group**: The inner `while` loop `(curr != nullptr && count < k)` naturally handles the last group, even if it has fewer than `k` nodes. It simply reverses whatever nodes are left.
