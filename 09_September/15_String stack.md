## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `pat` and `tar` consisting of lowercase English characters. You can construct a new string `s` by performing any one of the following operations for each character in `pat`:

1.  **Append** the character `pat[i]` to the string `s`.
2.  **Delete** the **last** character of `s` (if `s` is empty do nothing).

After performing operations on every character of `pat` exactly once, your goal is to determine if it is possible to make the string `s` equal to string `tar`.

---

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pat = "geuaek", tar = "geek"
Output: true
Explanation:
Append the first three characters of pat to s, resulting in s = "geu".
Delete the last character for 'a', leaving s = "ge".
Then, append the last two characters 'e' and 'k' from pat to s,
resulting in s = "geek", which matches tar.
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ <strong>Example 1 Breakdown</strong></summary>

Let's trace the operations required to form "geek" from "geuaek":

1.  **pat[0] = 'g'**: Append 'g'. `s = "g"`
2.  **pat[1] = 'e'**: Append 'e'. `s = "ge"`
3.  **pat[2] = 'u'**: Append 'u'. `s = "geu"`
4.  **pat[3] = 'a'**: Delete last char. `s = "ge"`
    - (Note: The operation for 'u' (append) and 'a' (pop) effectively cancel each other out. This is the key insight.)
5.  **pat[4] = 'e'**: Append 'e'. `s = "gee"`
6.  **pat[5] = 'k'**: Append 'k'. `s = "geek"`

The final string `s` matches `tar`. Thus, the output is **true**.

</details>

**Example 2:**

```
Input: pat = "agiffghd", tar = "gfg"
Output: true
Explanation:
Skip the first character 'a' in pat.
Append 'g' and 'i' to s, resulting in s = "gi".
Delete the last character for 'f', leaving s = "g".
Append 'f', 'g', and 'h' to s, resulting in s = "gfgh".
Finally, delete the last character for 'd', leaving s = "gfg", which matches tar.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: pat = "ufahs", tar = "aus"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to construct the string tar from pat with the given operations.
```

## Solution Approaches

This problem, while disguised as a stack problem, is actually a **subsequence matching problem with a strict parity constraint.**

The core realization is that every operation must be used exactly once. An "append" operation is either a **match** (if it matches the next character in `tar`) or **junk**. A "pop" operation (which can only happen on a non-empty stack) must cancel a previously appended junk character.

This means all junk characters must come in pairs: one "append" (junk) and one "pop" (which must also be assigned to a junk character's turn).

This creates two critical parity constraints:

1.  **Internal Gaps:** The number of junk characters _between_ any two consecutive matches (say `pat[i]` matching `tar[j]` and `pat[k]` matching `tar[j+1]`) must be **EVEN**. The count is `k - i - 1`. For this gap to be even, `k` and `i` must have **DIFFERENT** parities.
2.  **Final Gap:** The number of junk characters _after_ the final match (say `pat[k_last]` matching `tar[M-1]`) until the end of `pat` (`pat[N-1]`) must also be **EVEN**. The count is `N - 1 - k_last`. For this gap to be even, `N-1` and `k_last` must have the **SAME** parity.

Therefore, we must find `tar` as a subsequence in `pat` such that the indices of the matches **strictly alternate parity** (e.g., EVEN, ODD, EVEN...) AND the final match's parity matches the parity of `N-1`.

### Optimized Approach (Parity DP & Precomputation)

We track two independent paths simultaneously:

1.  The subsequence path that is currently required to end on an **EVEN** index.
2.  The subsequence path that is currently required to end on an **ODD** index.

We precompute two tables (`next_even` and `next_odd`) in O(N) time. `next_even[i][c]` stores the first _even_ index `>= i` where `pat` has character `c`.

When looking for `tar[j]`:

- To find its match for the EVEN-ending path, we look for `next_even` _after_ the last ODD match (`last_o + 1`).
- To find its match for the ODD-ending path, we look for `next_odd` _after_ the last EVEN match (`last_e + 1`).

If, after matching all of `tar`, the `last_e` path is valid AND `(N-1)` is also EVEN, we return true. OR, if the `last_o` path is valid AND `(N-1)` is also ODD, we return true.

<summary><h3>C++ Solution (Optimized Parity DP)</h3></summary>

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem requires processing each character of 'pat' as either an "append" or a "pop". Any "append" of a junk character (one not matching the 'tar' sequence) must later be cancelled by a "pop" operation, which must also come from a junk character's turn. This implies all junk characters must be able to be paired up.
// Approach:
// 1. This creates a parity constraint. We must find 'tar' as a subsequence within 'pat'.
// 2. Any junk characters *between* two consecutive matches (say pat[i] for tar[j] and pat[k] for tar[j+1]) must be paired. The number of such chars is (k - i - 1). This count must be EVEN. This means k and i must have DIFFERENT parities.
// 3. Junk chars *before* the first match (pat[i_0] for tar[0]) don't matter; their operations can all be "pop" on an empty stack.
// 4. Junk chars *after* the final match (pat[i_last] for tar[M-1]) must also be paired. The count is (N - 1 - i_last). This must be EVEN. This means (N-1) and i_last must have the SAME parity.
// 5. So, we need to find a subsequence matching 'tar' where pat-indices alternate in parity (odd, even, odd, ...) OR (even, odd, even, ...).
// 6. We precompute two 2D arrays: `next_even[i][char]` (first EVEN index >= i with that char) and `next_odd[i][char]` (first ODD index >= i). This takes O(N).
// 7. We then iterate through 'tar' (j=0 to M-1) tracking two states:
//    - `last_even_idx`: The minimum pat-index that matches tar[0...j] ending on an EVEN index.
//    - `last_odd_idx`: The minimum pat-index that matches tar[0...j] ending on an ODD index.
// 8. To find the next match for tar[j] at an EVEN index, it must follow a previous ODD match: `next_even[last_odd_idx + 1]...`.
// 9. To find the next match for tar[j] at an ODD index, it must follow a previous EVEN match: `next_odd[last_even_idx + 1]...`.
// 10. After matching all of 'tar', we check the final condition:
//     - If we found a path ending at `last_even_idx`, we check if its parity matches (N-1)'s parity. (i.e., (N-1)%2 == 0).
//     - If we found a path ending at `last_odd_idx`, we check if its parity matches (N-1)'s parity. (i.e., (N-1)%2 == 1).
//     - If either is true, we return true.
// Time Complexity: O(N + M), where N=pat.size(), M=tar.size(). O(N) to build the 26*N next-char tables, and O(M) to iterate through 'tar' with O(1) table lookups.
// Space Complexity: O(N), for the 26*N (which is O(N)) lookup tables.

## üîë Key Insights

The problem is a dynamic programming optimization of a subsequence problem. The crucial insight is that the "append/pop" operations are a red herring; the real constraint is that any non-matching "junk" characters (both the appends and the pops that remove them) must be paired up, forcing an **even gap** between consecutive matches.

This transforms the problem into: "Can we find `tar` as a subsequence of `pat` such that the indices of the matching characters strictly alternate parity (EVEN, ODD, EVEN...) AND the parity of the final match index equals the parity of the final index of `pat` (N-1)?"

By precomputing the next available ODD and EVEN index for every character, we can check both required alternating-parity paths (the one starting EVEN and the one starting ODD) in a single O(M) pass over `tar`.

- **Follow-up Question:** How would the solution change if the "pop" operation could remove _any_ character from `s`, not just the last one?
- **Follow-up Question:** How would the solution change if "pop" operations were free, meaning they didn't consume one of the `pat[i]` character turns?
