## Problem Statement

Design a **SpecialQueue** data structure that functions like a normal queue but with additional support for retrieving the **minimum** and **maximum** element efficiently.

The `SpecialQueue` must support the following operations:
- `enqueue(x)`: Insert an element `x` at the rear of the queue.
- `dequeue()`: Remove the element from the front of the queue.
- `getFront()`: Return the front element without removing it.
- `getMin()`: Return the minimum element in the queue in **O(1)** time.
- `getMax()`: Return the maximum element in the queue in **O(1)** time.

You will be given a sequence of queries `queries[][]`. The queries are represented in numeric form:
- `1 x`: Call `enqueue(x)`
- `2`: Call `dequeue()`
- `3`: Call `getFront()`
- `4`: Call `getMin()`
- `5`: Call `getMax()`

You only need to implement the five functions. It is guaranteed that all queries are valid.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: q = 6, queries[][] = [[1, 4], [1, 2], [3], [4], [2], [5]]
Output: [4, 2, 2]
Explanation:
1. enqueue(4): Queue: [4]
2. enqueue(2): Queue: [4, 2]
3. getFront(): Returns 4.
4. getMin(): Returns 2.
5. dequeue(): Removes 4. Queue: [2]
6. getMax(): Returns 2.
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example Breakdown</summary>

Let's trace the state of our `SpecialQueue` and its helper deques (`min_dq`, `max_dq`) for the first example:

- **Initial State:** `q: []`, `min_dq: []`, `max_dq: []`

1.  **`enqueue(4)`:**
    - `q.push(4)` -> `q: [4]`
    - `min_dq` is empty, `min_dq.push_back(4)` -> `min_dq: [4]`
    - `max_dq` is empty, `max_dq.push_back(4)` -> `max_dq: [4]`

2.  **`enqueue(2)`:**
    - `q.push(2)` -> `q: [4, 2]`
    - `min_dq.back() (4) > 2`, so `min_dq.pop_back()` -> `min_dq: []`. Then `min_dq.push_back(2)` -> `min_dq: [2]`
    - `max_dq.back() (4) > 2`, no change. `max_dq.push_back(2)` -> `max_dq: [4, 2]`

3.  **`getFront()`:**
    - `q.front()` is **4**. Output: `[4]`

4.  **`getMin()`:**
    - `min_dq.front()` is **2**. Output: `[4, 2]`

5.  **`dequeue()`:**
    - `frontVal = q.front()` -> `frontVal = 4`
    - `frontVal (4) != min_dq.front() (2)`, no change to `min_dq`.
    - `frontVal (4) == max_dq.front() (4)`, so `max_dq.pop_front()` -> `max_dq: [2]`
    - `q.pop()` -> `q: [2]`

6.  **`getMax()`:**
    - `max_dq.front()` is **2**. Output: `[4, 2, 2]`

</details>

### Example 2:

```
Input: q = 4, queries[][] = [[1, 3], [4], [1, 5], [5]]
Output: [3, 5]
Explanation:
1. enqueue(3): Queue: [3]
2. getMin(): Returns 3.
3. enqueue(5): Queue: [3, 5]
4. getMax(): Returns 5.
```

## Solution Approach

The core idea is to use a primary `queue` to store the elements and two auxiliary `deque` (double-ended queues) to efficiently track the minimum and maximum elements.

- **`min_dq`**: This deque is maintained in a monotonically increasing order. The front of this deque will always be the smallest element currently in the queue.
- **`max_dq`**: This deque is maintained in a monotonically decreasing order. The front of this deque will always be the largest element currently in the queue.

This setup allows us to retrieve the min and max values in **O(1)** time.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The challenge is to get the min/max elements from a queue in O(1) time. A standard queue doesn't support this efficiently. We can use auxiliary data structures, specifically deques, to keep track of potential minimum and maximum values.
// Approach:
// 1. Use a standard `std::queue` as the main storage for queue elements.
// 2. Use two `std::deque`s: `min_dq` to track minimums and `max_dq` to track maximums.
// 3. For `enqueue(x)`:
//    - Push `x` to the main queue.
//    - For `min_dq`: Remove all elements from the back that are greater than `x`. Then push `x`. This maintains a monotonically increasing deque, so the minimum is always at the front.
//    - For `max_dq`: Remove all elements from the back that are less than `x`. Then push `x`. This maintains a monotonically decreasing deque, so the maximum is always at the front.
// 4. For `dequeue()`:
//    - Get the front element from the main queue.
//    - If this element is also at the front of `min_dq` or `max_dq`, pop it from them as well, since it's being removed from the main queue.
//    - Pop from the main queue.
// 5. `getMin()` and `getMax()` simply return the front elements of `min_dq` and `max_dq` respectively.
// Time Complexity: O(1) for all operations (amortized). Each element is pushed and popped from the deques at most once.
// Space Complexity: O(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of elements in the queue, as the deques could potentially store all elements.

class SpecialQueue {
    // Main queue to store elements
    queue<int> q;
    // Deque to get the minimum element in O(1)
    deque<int> min_dq;
    // Deque to get the maximum element in O(1)
    deque<int> max_dq;

public:
    /**
     * @brief Inserts an element at the rear of the queue and updates min/max deques.
     * @param x The integer element to be inserted.
     */
    void enqueue(int x) {
        // Push the element to the main queue
        q.push(x);

        // Maintain the min_dq to have elements in increasing order.
        // Remove elements from the back of min_dq that are larger than the new element.
        while (!min_dq.empty() && min_dq.back() > x) {
            min_dq.pop_back();
        }
        min_dq.push_back(x);

        // Maintain the max_dq to have elements in decreasing order.
        // Remove elements from the back of max_dq that are smaller than the new element.
        while (!max_dq.empty() && max_dq.back() < x) {
            max_dq.pop_back();
        }
        max_dq.push_back(x);
    }

    /**
     * @brief Removes the element from the front of the queue and updates min/max deques if needed.
     */
    void dequeue() {
        int frontVal = q.front();

        // If the front element is the current minimum, it's no longer in the queue.
        if (frontVal == min_dq.front()) {
            min_dq.pop_front();
        }

        // If the front element is the current maximum, it's no longer in the queue.
        if (frontVal == max_dq.front()) {
            max_dq.pop_front();
        }

        // Remove the element from the main queue
        q.pop();
    }

    /**
     * @brief Returns the front element of the queue.
     * @return The front element.
     */
    int getFront() {
        return q.front();
    }

    /**
     * @brief Returns the minimum element in the queue.
     * @return The minimum element.
     */
    int getMin() {
        // The front of min_dq is always the smallest element.
        return min_dq.front();
    }

    /**
     * @brief Returns the maximum element in the queue.
     * @return The maximum element.
     */
    int getMax() {
        // The front of max_dq is always the largest element.
        return max_dq.front();
    }
};

## Key Insights

The solution's efficiency comes from the clever use of deques to maintain sorted-like structures.
- By removing useless elements from the back during `enqueue`, we ensure that the front of `min_dq` is always the current minimum and the front of `max_dq` is the current maximum among all elements still present in the main queue.
- This avoids the need to iterate through the entire queue to find the min/max, which would be an O(N) operation. The amortized time complexity for enqueue and dequeue remains O(1).

## Further Exploration

- **Sliding Window Maximum:** This problem uses a similar deque-based technique to find the maximum in every sliding window of size `k`.
- **Min Stack:** A classic problem where you need to design a stack that supports `getMin()` in O(1) time. The same principle of an auxiliary data structure applies.
- **Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search, and `getRandom` in O(1) time.**
