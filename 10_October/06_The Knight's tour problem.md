## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. There is an `n x n` chessboard with a Knight starting at the top-left corner `(0, 0)`. Your task is to determine a valid **Knight's Tour**, where the Knight visits every square exactly once, following the standard movement rules of a chess Knight (two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular). For example, if a Knight is placed at cell (2, 2), in one move it can move to any of the following cells: (4, 3), (4, 1), (0, 3), (0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 0), (1, 4), and (1, 0).

You have to return the order in which each cell is visited. If a solution exists, return the sequence of numbers (starting from 0) representing the order of visited squares. If no solution is possible, return an empty list.

**Note:** You can return any valid ordering. If it is correct, the driver code will print `true`; otherwise, it will print `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1: `n = 5`

**Input:** `n = 5`

**Output:**

```
[[0, 11, 2, 17, 20],
 [3, 16, 19, 12, 7],
 [10, 1, 6, 21, 18],
 [15, 4, 23, 8, 13],
 [24, 9, 14, 5, 22]]
```

**Explanation:** A possible Knight's Tour in a 5x5 chessboard is given above, where each number represents the step at which the Knight visits that cell, starting from (0, 0) as step 0.

### Example 2: `n = 4`

**Input:** `n = 4`

**Output:** `[]`

**Explanation:** For `n = 4`, it is not possible to have a valid Knight's Tour, so you have to return an empty list.

## Solution Approaches

### Backtracking Approach

The core idea is to use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible paths for the Knight. We start at `(0, 0)` and recursively try all 8 possible moves. If a move is valid (within the board and not yet visited), we mark the square and recurse. If the recursive call doesn't lead to a solution, we backtrack by un-marking the square.

#### C++ Solution

```cpp
// Intuition: The problem asks for a path that visits every square on a chessboard exactly once, which is a classic backtracking problem. We can explore paths recursively, and if a path leads to a dead end, we backtrack and try another.
// Approach:
// 1. Initialize an n x n board with -1 to indicate that no squares have been visited.
// 2. Start the tour from the top-left corner (0, 0) and mark it as step 0.
// 3. Use a recursive utility function `knightTourUtil` that takes the current position (x, y), the current step number, the board size n, and the board itself.
// 4. The base case for the recursion is when the step number equals n*n, meaning all squares have been visited. In this case, a solution is found.
// 5. In the recursive function, iterate through all 8 possible moves of a knight.
// 6. For each move, check if the new position is "safe" (within the board and not yet visited).
// 7. If the move is safe, mark the new square with the current step number and make a recursive call for the next step from the new position.
// 8. If the recursive call returns true, it means a solution has been found, so propagate this true value up the call stack.
// 9. If the recursive call returns false, it means this move did not lead to a solution, so backtrack by resetting the square to -1 and try the next move.
// 10. If all 8 moves are tried and none lead to a solution, return false.
// Time Complexity: O(8^(n^2)), as from each of the n*n cells, we have 8 choices.
// Space Complexity: O(n^2) for the board and the recursion stack.

class Solution {
public:
    // Arrays to represent the 8 possible moves of a knight from a position (x, y)
    // dx for change in x-coordinate, dy for change in y-coordinate
    int dx[8] = {2, 1, -1, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2};
    int dy[8] = {1, 2, 2, 1, -1, -2, -2, -1};

    // Utility function to check if a move to (x, y) is valid
    bool isSafe(int x, int y, int n, vector<vector<int>> &board) {
        // A move is safe if:
        // 1. The new position is within the board boundaries (0 to n-1).
        // 2. The square has not been visited yet (marked as -1).
        return (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < n &&
                y < n && board[x][y] == -1);
    }

    // Recursive backtracking function to find the Knight's Tour
    bool knightTourUtil(int x, int y, int step, int n, vector<vector<int>> &board) {

        // Base case: If all squares are visited, the tour is complete.
        // The 'step' variable is the count of visited squares. When it equals n*n, we're done.
        if (step == n * n) {
            return true;
        }

        // Try all 8 possible moves from the current position (x, y)
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            int nx = x + dx[i]; // Calculate the next x-coordinate
            int ny = y + dy[i]; // Calculate the next y-coordinate

            // If the next move is valid
            if (isSafe(nx, ny, n, board)) {
                // Make the move: mark the square with the current step number
                board[nx][ny] = step;

                // Recur for the next step from the new position
                if (knightTourUtil(nx, ny, step + 1, n, board)) {
                    // If the recursive call finds a solution, propagate 'true' up
                    return true;
                }

                // If the move doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack:
                // Un-mark the square (reset to -1) and try the next move in the loop
                board[nx][ny] = -1;
            }
        }

        // If no move from the current position leads to a solution, return false
        return false;
    }

    // Main function to initiate the Knight's Tour
    vector<vector<int>> knightTour(int n) {
        // Initialize the n x n board with -1 to mark all squares as unvisited
        vector<vector<int>> board(n, vector<int>(n, -1));

        // The Knight starts at the top-left corner (0, 0). This is step 0.
        board[0][0] = 0;

        // Start the backtracking process from (0, 0) for the next step (step 1)
        if (knightTourUtil(0, 0, 1, n, board)) {
            // If the utility function returns true, a solution was found. Return the board.
            return board;
        }

        // **CORRECTION**: If no solution is found, return an empty vector as required.
        return {};
    }
};

/*
*
* Dry Run (n = 3)
*
* Initial board:
* [[0, -1, -1],
* [-1, -1, -1],
* [-1, -1, -1]]
*
* Start at (0, 0), step = 1.
* Possible moves from (0,0): (2,1), (1,2)
* Try move to (2,1): board[2][1] = 1.
* New board:
* [[0, -1, -1],
* [-1, -1, -1],
* [-1, 1, -1]]
*
* From (2,1), step = 2.
* Possible moves: (0,2), (1,3) - invalid, (3,3) - invalid, (4,2) - invalid, (4,0) - invalid, (3,-1) - invalid, (1,-1) - invalid, (0,0) - visited.
* Try move to (0,2): board[0][2] = 2.
* ... and so on. The algorithm will explore paths, and if it hits a dead end, it will backtrack.
* For n=3, no solution exists, so the function will eventually return an empty vector.

## Key Insights

- **Backtracking is essential** for this type of problem, where we need to explore a sequence of choices and can determine that a path is incorrect partway through.
- The problem has a **high time complexity** due to the large number of possible paths (branching factor of 8). For small `n`, it's feasible, but it becomes impractical for larger boards.
- The solution might not be unique; any valid tour is an acceptable answer.

## Further Exploration

- **Warnsdorff's Rule:** A heuristic for finding a knight's tour that often works well in practice. The rule is to always move to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves.
- **Closed vs. Open Tours:** A closed tour is one where the knight's final move lands it on a square that is one knight's move away from the starting square. An open tour is any other valid tour.
- **Larger `n`:** For larger values of `n`, more advanced algorithms or heuristics are needed to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time.
