## üìù Problem Statement

Given a **sorted** integer array `arr[]` and an integer `k`, determine if it is possible to split the array into one or more **consecutive subsequences** such that:

1.  Each subsequence consists of **consecutive integers** (each number is exactly one greater than the previous).
2.  Every subsequence has a **length of at least `k`**.

Return `true` if such a split is possible, otherwise return `false`.

## üß™ Examples

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
Output: true
`````

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example Breakdown</summary>

The array `arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]` needs to be split into consecutive subsequences, each of length at least `k = 2`.

1.  We encounter the first `2`. Start a subsequence: `[2]`
2.  We encounter the second `2`. Start another subsequence: `[2]`
3.  We encounter the first `3`. It can extend the first subsequence `[2]` -\> `[2, 3]`
4.  We encounter the second `3`. It can extend the second subsequence `[2]` -\> `[2, 3]`
5.  We encounter `4`. Start a new subsequence (since both `3`s are used): `[4]`
6.  We encounter `5`. It can extend the subsequence `[4]` -\> `[4, 5]`

The resulting subsequences are `[2, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, and `[4, 5]`.
All subsequences are consecutive, and their lengths (`2`, `2`, `2`) are all greater than or equal to `k = 2`.
Therefore, the output is `true`.

</details>

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 4
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to split arr into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 4 or more.
```

## üí° Solution Approach

### Optimized Approach (Using Min-Heap)

The core idea is to greedily extend existing subsequences whenever possible. We use a min-heap to keep track of the subsequences currently being formed. The heap stores pairs `(last_element, length)`, prioritizing subsequences that end with a smaller number and, among those, subsequences with shorter lengths. This prioritization helps ensure we extend shorter subsequences first, making it easier to meet the length `k` requirement.

```cpp
// Intuition: We want to greedily assign each number to an existing consecutive subsequence.
//            If a number `x` arrives, we prefer attaching it to a subsequence ending in `x-1`.
//            Among subsequences ending in `x-1`, we prioritize the shortest one to help it reach length `k`.
//            A min-heap is suitable for managing the "ending number" and "length" of active subsequences.
// Approach:
// 1. Initialize a min-heap `pq` storing pairs `{end_number, length}`.
// 2. Define a custom comparator for the heap:
//    - Prioritize smaller `end_number`.
//    - If `end_number` is the same, prioritize smaller `length` (min-heap stores pairs such that `a.second > b.second` means `a` has higher priority).
// 3. Iterate through the input array `arr`:
//    a. If the heap is empty, start a new subsequence: push `{arr[i], 1}`.
//    b. Get the top element `top = {end_num, len}` from the heap.
//    c. If `arr[i] == end_num`: Start a new subsequence with `arr[i]`: push `{arr[i], 1}`.
//    d. If `arr[i] == end_num + 1`: Extend the subsequence at the top: pop `top`, push `{arr[i], len + 1}`.
//    e. If `arr[i] > end_num + 1`: The subsequence `top` cannot be extended further. Check if its length `len < k`. If so, return `false`. Otherwise, pop `top` and *re-process* `arr[i]` (stay at the same index `i` by not incrementing).
// 4. After iterating through `arr`, check any remaining subsequences in the heap. If any subsequence has `length < k`, return `false`.
// 5. If all checks pass, return `true`.
// Time Complexity: O(N log N), where N is the size of `arr`. Each element is pushed and popped from the heap at most once. Heap operations take O(log N) time (heap size can be up to N).
// Space Complexity: O(N), in the worst case, the heap might store N elements if all numbers are distinct and start new subsequences.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // Custom comparator for the min-heap
        auto comp = [](pair<int, int> a, pair<int, int> b) {
            // If numbers are different, prioritize the smaller number
            if (a.first != b.first) {
                return a.first > b.first; // Min-heap based on the ending number
            }
            // If numbers are the same, prioritize the shorter subsequence length
            return a.second > b.second; // Min-heap based on length (shorter first)
        };

        // Min-heap stores pairs: {end_number, length of subsequence ending with end_number}
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, decltype(comp)> pq(comp);

        int i = 0;
        while (i < arr.size()) {
            // Remove completed subsequences that cannot be extended by arr[i]
            while (!pq.empty() && arr[i] > pq.top().first + 1) {
                // If a subsequence ends too early and its length is less than k, return false
                if (pq.top().second < k) {
                    return false;
                }
                pq.pop(); // Remove the valid, completed subsequence
            }

            if (pq.empty()) {
                // If heap is empty or no suitable subsequence exists, start a new one
                pq.push({arr[i], 1});
                i++;
            } else {
                // If current number matches the end of the highest priority subsequence
                if (arr[i] == pq.top().first) {
                     // Start a new subsequence (as the existing one with the same end number might be shorter)
                    pq.push({arr[i], 1});
                    i++;
                }
                // If current number can extend the highest priority subsequence
                else if (arr[i] == pq.top().first + 1) {
                    auto top = pq.top(); // Get the top element
                    pq.pop();           // Remove it
                    // Push the extended subsequence back
                    pq.push({arr[i], top.second + 1});
                    i++;
                } else {
                     // This case (arr[i] < pq.top().first) shouldn't happen due to the sorted array and the cleanup loop above.
                     // If arr[i] > pq.top().first + 1, it's handled by the cleanup loop.
                     // Defensive programming: If somehow we reach here, start a new subsequence.
                     pq.push({arr[i], 1});
                     i++;
                }
            }
        }

        // After processing all numbers, check if all remaining subsequences in the heap have length >= k
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            if (pq.top().second < k) {
                return false; // Found an incomplete subsequence
            }
            pq.pop(); // Remove valid subsequence
        }

## üîë Key Insights

  - **Greedy Approach:** The core idea is to always try and extend the "most needy" existing subsequence first. The "most needy" is defined as the one ending with the smallest number (`x-1`) and having the shortest current length.
  - **Min-Heap Utility:** A min-heap perfectly models this greedy strategy. It allows efficient retrieval (`O(log N)`) of the subsequence that should be prioritized for extension. The custom comparator ensures we prioritize correctly based on the ending number and then the length.
  - **Handling Gaps:** When the current number `arr[i]` is greater than `pq.top().first + 1`, it signifies that the subsequence represented by `pq.top()` cannot be extended further. At this point, we *must* check if it meets the length requirement `k`. If it does, we discard it (pop); otherwise, we know it's impossible to form valid subsequences, and we return `false`.
