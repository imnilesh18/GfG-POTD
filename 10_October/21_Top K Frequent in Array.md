## üìù Problem Statement

Given a non-empty integer array `arr[]`, your task is to find and return the top `k` elements that have the **highest frequency** in the array.

**Note:** If two numbers have the same frequency, the **larger number** should be given higher priority.

---

## üß™ Examples

### Example 1
```
Input:
arr[] = [3, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1]
k = 2

Output:
[4, 1]

Explanation:
Frequency of 4 is 2.
Frequency of 1 is 2.
These two have the maximum frequency. Since 4 is larger than 1, it gets higher priority.
```

<details>
<summary>üìñ Example 1 Breakdown</summary>

1.  **Count Frequencies:**
    * `3`: 1
    * `1`: 2
    * `4`: 2
    * `5`: 1
    * `2`: 1
    * `6`: 1
2.  **Identify Highest Frequencies:** The highest frequency is 2, which belongs to elements `1` and `4`.
3.  **Apply Tie-Breaker:** We need the top `k=2` elements. Both `1` and `4` have the same frequency (2). The problem states that the larger number gets higher priority.
4.  **Final Result:** Since `4 > 1`, the order is `[4, 1]`.

</details>

### Example 2
```
Input:
arr[] = [7, 10, 11, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 11, 8, 9]
k = 4

Output:
[5, 11, 7, 10]

Explanation:
Frequency of 5 is 3.
Frequency of 11 is 2.
Frequency of 7 is 2.
Frequency of 10 is 1.
The top 4 frequent elements are 5, 11, 7, and 10.
```

## üí° Solution Approaches

### Optimized Approach: Using a Hash Map and Min-Heap

The most efficient way to solve this is to first count the frequency of each element using a hash map. Then, we can use a min-heap (priority queue) of size `k` to keep track of the top `k` most frequent elements encountered so far.

The min-heap stores pairs of `{frequency, element}`. By keeping the heap size at most `k`, we ensure that the element with the smallest frequency is always at the top, ready to be removed if a more frequent element comes along.

#### C++ Solution
```cpp
// Intuition: We can find the top k frequent elements by first counting the frequency of each element and then using a data structure to find the k elements with the highest frequencies. A min-heap is ideal for this, as it allows us to maintain a collection of the top k elements efficiently.

// Approach:
// 1. Create an unordered_map to store the frequency of each element in the input array.
// 2. Iterate through the array and populate the map.
// 3. Create a min-heap (priority_queue in C++) to store pairs of {frequency, element}.
// 4. Iterate through the frequency map. For each pair:
//    a. Push the {frequency, element} pair into the min-heap.
//    b. If the heap's size exceeds k, pop the top element (which has the smallest frequency).
// 5. After iterating through the map, the heap will contain the top k frequent elements.
// 6. Extract the elements from the heap and store them in a result vector. Since it's a min-heap, we populate the result from the end to get the correct descending order of frequency.

// Time Complexity: O(N log K), where N is the number of elements in the array. It takes O(N) to build the frequency map and O(N log K) to iterate through the map and perform heap operations.
// Space Complexity: O(N) for the unordered_map in the worst case (if all elements are unique) plus O(K) for the priority queue. So, the total space complexity is O(N).

class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> topKFreq(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        // Use a hash map to count the frequency of each element
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        for (int val: arr)
            mp[val]++;
    
        // Min-heap to keep track of top k frequent elements
        // The pair stores {frequency, element}
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, 
        vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
        
        // Iterate through the frequency map
        for (pair<int, int> entry : mp) {
            
            // Push the current element and its frequency into the heap
            pq.push({entry.second, entry.first});
            
            // If heap size exceeds k, remove the element with the smallest frequency
            if (pq.size() > k)
                pq.pop();
        }
    
        // Create a result vector of size k
        vector<int> res(k);
    
        // Extract elements from the heap in descending frequency order
        // We fill the result array from the end because the min-heap returns the smallest first
        for (int i = k-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[i] = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};

/*
*
* Dry Run
*
* Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1], k = 2
*
* 1. Frequency Map (mp):
* - After iterating through arr:
* mp = {{3, 1}, {1, 2}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}, {2, 1}, {6, 1}}
*
* 2. Min-Heap (pq) of size k=2:
* - Process {3, 1}: pq.push({1, 3}). pq = {{1, 3}}
* - Process {1, 2}: pq.push({2, 1}). pq = {{1, 3}, {2, 1}}
* - Process {4, 2}: pq.push({2, 4}). pq = {{1, 3}, {2, 1}, {2, 4}}. Size > 2, so pq.pop(). pq = {{2, 1}, {2, 4}}
* - Process {5, 1}: pq.push({1, 5}). pq = {{1, 5}, {2, 1}, {2, 4}}. Size > 2, so pq.pop(). pq = {{2, 1}, {2, 4}}
* - Process {2, 1}: pq.push({1, 2}). pq = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 4}}. Size > 2, so pq.pop(). pq = {{2, 1}, {2, 4}}
* - Process {6, 1}: pq.push({1, 6}). pq = {{1, 6}, {2, 1}, {2, 4}}. Size > 2, so pq.pop(). pq = {{2, 1}, {2, 4}}
*
* 3. Final Heap Content:
* - pq = {{2, 1}, {2, 4}} (Note: order might vary internally, but these are the elements)
*
* 4. Extract Result:
* - Initialize res of size 2.
* - i = 1: res[1] = pq.top().second (which is 1). pq.pop(). pq = {{2, 4}}
* - i = 0: res[0] = pq.top().second (which is 4). pq.pop(). pq is empty.
*
* 5. Final Result:
* - res = [4, 1]

## üéØ Key Insights

-   The **hash map** is crucial for achieving an efficient frequency count in O(N) time.
-   A **min-heap** is preferred over a max-heap. While a max-heap could find the top `k` elements after populating it with all N unique elements, this would take O(N log N) time. A min-heap of size `k` allows us to process all unique elements in O(N log K) time, which is more efficient when `k` is much smaller than `N`.
-   The tie-breaking rule (larger number has higher priority) is naturally handled by the final extraction step. Since we extract from a min-heap (which places smaller numbers first in case of a frequency tie) and fill our result array backward, the larger numbers for a given frequency end up being placed first in the final output.
